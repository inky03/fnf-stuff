this contains a bunch of old recharts/edits i made for the base game's HARD DIFFICULTY charts to make them easier to play with one hand, along with other changes. not all songs are included (as i didnt make all of them)<br>
have fun playing!!
## other notable changes
+ fresh's beatboxing section has been changed to match with the voices (bf singing "whip it" and "twist")
+ monster has been recharted to **correctly sync with the song's time signature and bpm changes.** see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjcIB1PtMTU) if you're interested
+ charted one bf note in philly nice that no one for some reason had ever decided to fix (~1:08)
+ some charts have added doubles (which should also be easy to hit one handed) to balance the song's score for each side (hold score not included)
