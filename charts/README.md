### quick note
all of these charts have been built in psych engine!! psych's chart format isnt particularly different from the (legacy) base game's, but does contain a major change; **sectionBeats**!!
this is used to modify the length of a section(bar?) which also changes the way some things may react to a song, such as camera zooming.
due to this, expect there to be some slight sync issues regarding camera zoom and whatnot when importing these to engines other than psych engine.<br>
phew! that wasn't so quick, but do keep that in mind!
