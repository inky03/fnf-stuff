***NOTE: THIS IS NO LONGER USED JUST FOR FNF STUFF!***

(03/24/24) im changing repository name to just my-stuff or something like that in a few days. just a heads up

# my stuff
repository with source files of ***my own work** for both fnf and non fnf projects (which you may find under "other/NON FNF"):
- .fla (flash/animate)
- .ase (aseprite)
- .png (portable network graphics. crazy!)

happy exploring! go wild!! (with credit of course)

\* other authors may be included on work due of collabs / animation cleanup. i get permission before adding in such cases and these authors are **fully credited** in READMEs (specifying what they/i've contributed)
