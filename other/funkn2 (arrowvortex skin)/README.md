## *funkn2* arrowvortex skin
originally posted to twitter a couple months ago but im hosting these here cuz discord will or may have already killed the files

## notes
- create a folder in noteskins folder with the name you want to put to the noteskin (this was obvious enough)
- half of the graphics in tex notes are missing because i couldnt find a way to put them in + i think theres no documentation :(
	- due to this dance double and other singleplayer ones only have a gray glow and gray holds
	- dance double with original note colors is the only one with colored glow and holds due to the parameters only working properly on it
- on the "dance X" folders, drag the txt of your preference for each and put it ON THE SAME LOCATION the graphics are
- if the noteskin is not showing up, go to **arrowvortex/settings/settings.txt** and add the name of the noteskin with a comma afterwards
